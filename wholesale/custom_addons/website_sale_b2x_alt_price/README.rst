This module takes into account if your eCommerce is in B2B or B2C mode,
and displays the alternative pricing next to the main one.

For example, if your website is B2B (main price is without taxes), you
would see it similar to this:

|b2b-features|

If your website is B2C (main price is with taxes), then it looks like
this:

|b2c-features|

It also displays the alternative price, including discounts, updated
automatically when the user is choosing alternatives in the product
detail page:

|details-features|

Configuration
=============

To choose if you want to display or not the alternative price in the
website products list, just enable or disable the feature from the
"Customize" tab of the web editor. This can be done independently per
website:

|toggle-list|

You can also toggle the behavior similarly in the product details page.
This can also be done independently per website:

|toggle-detail|

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Create a product.
2. Set some customer taxes on it.
3. Publish it.
4. Go see it on your website. It will display the alternative price.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Computing this requires 1 or 2 extra calls to ``taxes.compute_all()``
   per product. This could be expensive in terms of performance, but the
   truth is that it is also not very optimized upstream in Odoo. Maybe
   optimize this part in Odoo and in this module? Or maybe apply some
   hack to avoid recomputing this? Maybe cache calls to that method? Is
   it really a problem in the Real World®?
